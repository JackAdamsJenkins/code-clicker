# PLAN: Cybersecurity Promotion & New Game Mode

## 1. Overview
This update introduces a "Career Progression" system. When a player reaches the maximum commit limit (3000), they are offered a promotion to "Cybersecurity Specialist". Accepting this promotion unlocks a completely new game mode with unique mechanics, resources, and visuals, expanding the game beyond simple coding into the realm of security operations.

## 2. Core Mechanics

### 2.1. The Trigger
- **Condition:** Player reaches `commits >= 3000`.
- **Event:** A "Promotion Offer" modal appears.
- **Choice:**
  - **Accept:** Reset `linesOfCode`, `cps`, etc., but enter `Cybersecurity` mode.
  - **Decline:** Stay in current mode (can accept later via a button).

### 2.2. New Game Mode: Cybersecurity (SecOps)
- **Primary Resource:** `Encrypted Data` (or `Bounties`). Let's go with **`Entropy`** (representing chaos/complexity they are managing) generated by "Auditing".
- **Currency:** `Crypto` (generated by resolving threats).
- **Theme:** Darker, "Matrix" green/black, terminal aesthetics, hex codes visuals.
- **Click Action:** "Audit Network" -> Generates `Entropy`.
- **Passive Income:** "Botnets", "Firewalls", "White Hat Hackers".

*(Self-Correction for simplicity based on User Request "Interface evokes Cybersecurity"):*
Let's keep it consistent with the current engine but re-themed and re-balanced.
- **Resource:** `Gained Access` (KB/MB/GB).
- **Click:** "Hack" / "Brute Force".
- **Upgrades:**
  - *Script Kiddie Tools*
  - *SQL Injection Scripts*
  - *Zero-Day Exploits*
  - *Quantum Decryptor*

## 3. Architecture Changes

### 3.1. Store (`gameStore.ts`)
- Add `gameMode`: `'dev' | 'secops'` (default `'dev'`).
- Add `secops` specific state:
  - `entropy`: number (New resource).
  - `threatLevel`: number (Dynamic difficulty?).
  - `secopsUpgrades`: Separate list of upgrades.

### 3.2. Components
- **`PromotionModal.tsx`**: The bridge between modes.
- **`CyberLayout.tsx`**: The new interface.
  - distinct from `GameLayout` to allow complete visual overhaul.
  - Reuses UI primitives (buttons, panels) but with different styling context.

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (Backend/State)
1.  **Modify `useGameStore`**:
    - Add `gameMode: 'dev' | 'secops'`.
    - Add action `promoteToSecOps()`.
    - Allow `commits` to exceed 3000 if needed, or just use 3000 as the gate.

### Phase 2: UI - The Trigger
2.  **Create `PromotionModal`**:
    - Checks `useGameStore(s => s.commits >= 3000 && s.gameMode === 'dev')`.
    - Shows "Level Up: Cybersecurity".

### Phase 3: UI - The New Interface
3.  **Create `CyberLayout`**:
    - Darker background (pure black/green).
    - Terminal-like font (Monospace).
    - New `ClickArea` (Lock picking animation? or just different text).
    - New `UpgradePanel` (SecOps items).

### Phase 4: Integration
4.  **Update `App.tsx` (or `GameLayout` wrapper)**:
    - Switch between `StandardLayout` and `CyberLayout` based on `gameMode`.

## 5. Verification
- Test: Reach 3000 commits -> Modal appears.
- Test: Accept -> UI switches.
- Test: Mechanics in new mode work (clicking, upgrading).
